## 📖 About mie

mie is a tool that helps AI agents remember important facts, decisions, entities, and relationships over time. It works like a memory that stays even if you close a program or restart your computer. This memory is saved in a graph format, which means it connects different pieces of information to each other. This system works with several AI assistants, including Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, and any tools that use the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

You do not need any technical skills to use mie. This guide will take you through every step to download and use it.
